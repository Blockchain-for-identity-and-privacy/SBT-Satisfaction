# Soulbound tokens for customer satisfaction and digital property

This software project is part of the study entitled  "Soulbound Tokens For Certifying Customer Satisfaction With 
Quality Products" by Andrea Pinna, Maria Ilaria Lunesu, Roberto Tonelli and Andrea Tiddia, from Department of 
Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Cagliari.

The study was conducted following the Design Science Research method and include this software project as a 
proof-of-concept to investigate and answer two research questions.
- RQ1 How can blockchain technology and soulbound tokens enhance the role of the customer 
while effectively ensuring the authenticity of customer reviews? 
- RQ2. What impacts do these technologies have on consumer trust and product reputation? 

The repository contains three main folders:
- Contracts: the on-chain component composed of two interconnected soulbound NFT.
- Company-dApp: the user interface for the company to create new labels (as QR-code) of the quality products and display 
their collected certificates of satisfaction. 
- Customer-dApp: the user interface for the customer to obtain the digital ownership of a physically-owned product and 
mint certificates of satisfaction.

This repository require node.js installed in the server and metamask installed in the browser.
Both smart contracts must be deployed in a public blockchain and their address must be saved using the configuration page
of both dApps.
